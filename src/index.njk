    <h2>What's this?</h2>
<p>An RSS feed (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format that allows users to receive updates from websites in a structured and automatic way. It delivers new content, such as blog posts, news articles, or podcast episodes, directly to subscribers without them having to visit the website manually. </p>
<p>I learned about RSS feed recently and fell in love with the concept and everything related to these feeds. I made myself one, and wanted to see how it looked like in an RSS reader.</p>
<p>But, when I got myself a reader and saw that I only followed my feed... I felt so lonely.</p>
<p>This webring is for people who have an RSS feed (for their personal website) and want to find other people with RSS feeds to follow.</p>
<p>I know that's a bit weird m, like, who even thinks about making a ring for people with RSS feeds, right? Haha.<p/> 
<p>For that reason, and because not many people have (and know) about RSS feeds In The Year Of Our Lord 2024â„¢, I know it may be a bit hard to grow this ring, and also because not many people have their own RSS feed.</p>
<p>Also for that reason, I hope the members of this ring will grow a sense of community, subscribing to each other's feeds and visiting our websites everytime we're notified about updates.</p>
