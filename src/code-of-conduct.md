# Code of Conduct

Rules for being in this webring.

This webring is for people who have an RSS feed (for their personal website) and want to find other people with RSS feeds to follow.

I know that's a bit weird, like, who even thinks about making a ring for people with RSS feeds, right? Haha.

For that reason, and because not many people have (and know) about RSS feeds In The Year Of Our Lord 2024â„¢, I know it might be a bit hard to grow this ring.

Also for that reason, I hope the members of this ring will grow a sense of community, subscribing to each other's feeds and visiting our websites everytime we're notified about an update.

To join, you must:
*   Be a normal human being (don't be a bigot, troll, cryptobro, "alpha male", etc.)
*   Have a personal website. It doesn't have to be a neocities, but social media or corporations / big businesses aren't allowed.
*   Have an RSS (any version, or ATOM) feed for said website (you have to be able to access it via your website).
*   Be a bit active on your feed (a couple updates a year is the minimum, just don't abandon it).
*   Have fun!! Make as many updates as you want, promoting your projects is encouraged.
